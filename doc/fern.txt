INTRODUCTION						*fern-introduction*

*fern.vim* (fern) is a general purpose asynchronous tree explorer written in
pure Vim script.

It provides the following features

- Explorer or Drawer style
  - :Fern {url} to open in explorer style
  - :Fern {url} -drawer to open in drawer style
- Options are buffer name based to support re-opening
  - :e to reload content as like other buffer
  - Friendly for session
- Action based features
  - Hit a to choose action to perform
  - Hit . to repeat previous action
- Generic multi item renamer (like exrename in Shougo/vimfiler.vim)
  - "file" scheme provides multi file/directory renamer

And a builtin "file" scheme provides the following features

- Basic local file operations are supported
  - Perform |cd|, |lcd|, and |tcd| to a directory
  - Open file/directory with a system application
  - Create file/directory
  - Move file/directory
  - Remove file/directory
  - Copy/Paste file/directory through the internal clipboard
- System Trash-bin is supported
  - By osascript in macOS
  - By PowerShell in Windows
  - By andeafrancia/trash-cli
  - By b4b4r07/gomi

This plugin has strongly inspired by the following plugins

>
	:Ferm ~/Desktop
<
						*fern-usage-reveal*

"-reveal=..." option like
>
	:Fern . -reveal=autoload/fern/comparator/default.vim
<

>
  fern.vim
  |- autoload
   |- fern
    |+ command
    |- comparator
     |  default.vim
     |  lexical.vim
    |+ internal
    |+ lib
    |+ mapping
    |+ scheme
    |  helper.vim
    |  mapping.vim

Note that if you would like to use "%", use '<C-r>=expand("%")<CR>'.
>
	:Fern . -reveal=<C-r>=expand("%")<CR>
<
						*fern-usage-drawer*
If you prefer a drawer style (e.g. NERDTree), add "-drawer" to the command
like:

Then a fern drawer will be popped up to the left side. Note that behavior
between explorer and drawer is slightly different (e.g. "open:side" action.)
